# LLM-ranker
## Overview

- We introduce LLM-Blender, an innovative ensembling framework to attain consistently superior performance by leveraging the diverse strengths and weaknesses of multiple open-source large language models (LLMs). LLM-Blender cut the weaknesses through ranking and integrate the strengths through fusing generation to enhance the capability of LLMs.

- Our framework consists of two complementary modules: **PairRanker** and **GenFuser**, addressing the observation that optimal LLMs for different examples can significantly vary. **PairRanker** employs a specialized pairwise comparison method to distinguish subtle differences between candidate outputs. **GenFuser** aims to merge the top-ranked candidates from the aggregation of PairRanker's pairwise comparisons into an improved output by capitalizing on their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses.
- To facilitate large-scale evaluation, we introduce a benchmark dataset, [**MixInstruct**](#data_release), which is a mixture of multiple instruction datasets featuring oracle pairwise comparisons for testing purposes. Our **LLM-Blender** significantly surpasses the best LLMs and baseline ensembling methods across various metrics on **MixInstruct**, establishing a substantial performance gap.

## Data Release

- To facilitate large-scale evaluation, we introduce a benchmark dataset, **MixInstruct**, which is a mixture of multiple instruction datasets featuring oracle pairwise comparisons for testing purposes. 
- MixInstruct is the first large-scale dataset consisting of responses from 11 popular open-source LLMs on the instruction-following dataset. Each split of train/val/test contains 100k/5k/5k examples. 
- MixInstruct instruct is collected from 4 famous instruction dataset: Alpaca-GPT4, Dolly-15k, GPT4All-LAION and ShareGPT. The ground-truth outputs comes from either ChatGPT, GPT-4 or human annotations.
- MixInstruct is evaluated by both auto-metrics including BLEURT, BARTScore, BERTScore, etc. and ChatGPT. We provide 4771 examples on test split that is evaluated by ChatGPT through pariwise comparison.
- Code to construct the dataset: [`get_mixinstruct.py`](./src/download_dataset/get_mixinstruct.py)

## Usage

### Installtion

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuchenlin/LLM-Blender.git
cd LLM-Blender
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

See more details in [`train_ranker.sh`](./scripts/train_ranker.sh)

Please follow the guide in the script to train the ranker.

Here are some explanations for the script parameters:

**Changing the torchrun cmd**
```bash
TORCHRUN_CMD=<you torchrun cmd path>
```
Normally, it's just `torchrun` with proper conda env activated.

**Changing the dataset**

```bash
dataset="<your dataset>`
```

**Changing the ranker backbone**

```bash
backbone_type="deberta" # "deberta" or "roberta"
backbone_name="microsoft/deberta-v3-large" # "microsoft/deberta-v3-large" or "roberta-large"
```

**Changing the ranker type**
```bash
ranker="Pairranker" # "PairRanker" or "Summaranker" or "SimCLS"
```

**Filter the candidates used**
```bash
candidate_model="flan-t5-xxl" # or "alpaca-native"
candidate_decoding_method="top_p_sampling" 
n_candidates=15 # number of candidates to generate
using_metrics="rouge1,rouge2,rougeLsum,bleu" # metrics used to train the signal
```
**Do Training or Inference**
```bash
do_inference=False # training
do_inference=True # inference
```
When doing inference, you can change `inference_mode` to `bubble` or `full` to select difference pairwise inference model

**Limit the datasize used for training, dev and test**
```bash
max_train_data_size=-1 # -1 means no limit
max_eval_data_size=-1 # -1 means no limit
max_predict_data_size=-1 # -1 means no limit
```
**Do inference on dataset A with ranker training on dataset B**
```bash
dataset=<A>
checkpoint_trained_dataset=<B>
do_inference=True
```
